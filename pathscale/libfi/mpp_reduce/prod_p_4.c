/*
 *	Compiler generated call: CALL _PROD_JP4(RESULT, SOURCE, DIM, MASK)
 *				 CALL _PROD_SP4(RESULT, SOURCE, DIM, MASK)
 *
 *	Purpose: Compute the product of the elements of SOURCE along
 *	         dimension DIM corresponding to the true elements
 *	         of MASK. This particular routine handles source
 *	         arrays of rank 4 with a data type of 64-bit integer
 *	         or 64-bit floating point.
 *
 *	Arguments:
 *	        RESULT - Dope vector for temporary result array
 *	        SOURCE - Dope vector for user source array
 *	        DIM    - Dimension to operate along
 *	        MASK   - Dope vector for logical mask array
 *
 *      Description:
 *		This is the MPP version of PRODUCT. This particular
 *		file contains the the intermediate type-specific
 *		routines. These routines parse and update the dope
 *		vectors, allocate either shared or private space for
 *		the result temporary, and possibly update the shared
 *		data desriptor (sdd) for the result temporary. Once
 *		this set-up work is complete, a Fortran subroutine
 *		is called which uses features from the Fortran
 *		Programming Model to distribute the word across all
 *		processors.
 *
 *		Include file prod_p.h contains the rank independent
 *		source code for this routine.
